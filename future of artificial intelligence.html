<h2>future of artificial intelligence<h2>
<p style="font-size:19px;">Science-fiction has always fascinated guy, seeking to 
recreate some of the wildest engineering imaginations. 
Robots, smart machines, sophisticated software, artificial intelligence and neural networks were the product of this 
obsession and today we are at a point where all these are becoming a reality. 
We've come a long way from 
a pure dream to real advances. 
Artificial intelligence today is a fascinating wing of 
science and technology that shapes our future slowly.

If you didn't know, sophisticated computers and systems with the potential 
to make autonomous decisions have already made their way into existence. 
Amazon was a pioneer in the introduction of 
automated machines and its innovations were rather surreal. 
The Amazon Go shop, which aims to close the gap between eCommerce and brick-and - mortar shops, 
automated supply chain management systems, delivery drones are both examples of their baby steps towards automated artificial intelligence.<p>
