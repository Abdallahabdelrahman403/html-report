 <h2>Definition of artificial intelligence<h2>
 <p style="font-size:19px;">Artificial Intelligence ( AI) is a wide variety of computer science engaged in
the development of smart machines capable of performing tasks usually requiring human intelligence.
AI is a multi approach interdisciplinary science, but advances in machine learning and deep
learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.


Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) refers to human intelligence simulation of 
computers which are programmed to think like humans and imitate their behavior. 
The word can also refer to any computer that 
displays human mind-related characteristics such as learning and problem-solving.
The ideal feature of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and 
take action that has the best chance of attaining a specific objective. <p>
