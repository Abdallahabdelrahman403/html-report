<h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence<h2>

<img src="Artificial-Intelligence.png" alt="IMAGE">
<p style="font-size:19px;">The Artificial Intelligence applications are endless.
The system can be extended to a great many different industries and sectors.
In the healthcare sector, AI is being studied and used in patients for
dosing medications and various therapies, and in the operating room for 
surgical procedures.
Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.<p>
